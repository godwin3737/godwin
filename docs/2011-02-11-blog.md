After creating this page , it dawned upon me that the world and me no longer have time for blogs in the way they were once construed.  Its funny because just three years back blogs were the coolest things around.  So don't be surprised if one of these days you find this section down ( this is the first post to begin with &amp; i am already writing about pulling down the section ) . Wonder what the die hard blogger does these days . Tweets the fall of the blogger, perhaps ?
